## About
Welcome to my custom portfolio website for my personal projects! This was created using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and Adobe Illustrator.

## Features
- A contact form that posts messages to a realtime database (Firebase Database)
- Landing page backround animation is made using the p5.js library. It uses 1D Perlin Noise Randomness, draws the movement, and drags it out creating a mountian effect. No two instances will never match and are always unique!
- I cycle through three similar custom pixel art images made by yours truly using Adobe Illustrator to give a flying animation 
- The "about" section's pixel man is meant to resemble myself and cycles through two images to give a smiling effect :)

## Notes
Coming from a mathematical background is what led me to create the landing page animation using Perlin Noise. The aesthetic of classic video games such as Pokemon Red/Blue and Zelda led me to use the pixel art.
